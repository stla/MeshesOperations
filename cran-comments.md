* This is a new release.

* The second note is related to the html file generated by **cyclideMesh.Rd**. 
There is a figure in the 'Details' section, and a `<div>` tag is generated for 
this figure, enclosed in a `<p>` tag. It seems that there's no way to change 
that, and *tidy* makes a correction here, this is probably some invalid HTML.
